# Contribute to documentation

Use this page to decide which repository should host your documentation change.

## How documentation is split across repositories

- [`jupyter-book/jupyterbook.org`](https://github.com/jupyter-book/jupyterbook.org): Community/project pages (landing page, community content, project resources, contribution entrypoint).
- [`jupyter-book/jupyter-book`](https://github.com/jupyter-book/jupyter-book): User documentation for the Jupyter Book tool (served at `/stable` and `/latest`).
- [`jupyter-book/mystmd`](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd): MyST docs and developer guides ([mystmd.org](https://mystmd.org)).
- [`jupyter-book/myst-theme`](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme): Theme/UI docs and preview workflows.
- There is also repository-specific documentation in many repositories, but these are the major cross-project ones.
