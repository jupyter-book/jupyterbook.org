# Code contributions

Use this page to figure out where to contribute and what to do next.

## What kind of code contributions can I make?

You can contribute by:

- Fixing bugs reported in issues.
- Improving command-line behavior and developer workflows.
- Improving build, publishing, and execution features.
- Building plugins and extensions around the Jupyter Book ecosystem.

Or really, just do things that you think could be useful and improve our technical infrastructure. Be creative! We are happy to see people helping out.

## Where should I contribute?

Most technical changes happen in one of these repositories:

- [jupyter-book/mystmd](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd): Core document engine and much of the implementation work.
- [jupyter-book/myst-theme](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme): Theme and frontend behavior.
- [jupyter-book/jupyter-book](https://github.com/jupyter-book/jupyter-book): Python packaging, CLI distribution, and Jupyter Book-specific integration.
- [jupyter-book/myst-plugins](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-plugins): A community-maintained collection of several MyST plugins.

If you're unsure, start with a question in the [community chat](https://discord.mystmd.org) and we can help route it.
