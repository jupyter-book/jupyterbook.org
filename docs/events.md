The meeting schedule for Jupyter Book Collaboration Cafes
::::

### Monthly collaboration cafes

Collaboration cafes are a way for any member of the Jupyter Book community to remotely get together to share what they've been up to, have discussions, and work together. You are welcome to join as long as you're interested in Jupyter Book!

See [the Jupyter Book Collaboration Cafe notes](https://hackmd.io/@jupyter-book/collaboration-cafe) for more details and meeting notes.

:::{note} This is an experiment!
This is an experiment in opening up our team practices. [Here's a blog post explaining our goals][expt]. We'd love feedback on how we can improve these meetings in a sustainable way.

### Jupyter-wide events

There are also many other events in the Jupyter ecosystem! See the [Jupyter Community events page](https://jupyter.org/community) for events across the Jupyter community.
